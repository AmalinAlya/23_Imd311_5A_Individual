    Doing what you enjoy is the small source of inner satisfaction. Likewise for me. I enjoy playing badminton constantly as a hobby in my spare time. Since elementary school, I have been developing this kind of hobby. I have enjoyed playing badminton with my pals since I was in elementary school and through high school. I have not had any spare time to go outside since the covid-19 problem, though, so I felt a little frustrated that I could not do my hobby at all at that period.</p>

    Nowadays, it is normal for teenagers to like watching YouTube videos. It is akin to me because I enjoy using YouTube to gather information and watch instructional videos when I have free time.</p>
